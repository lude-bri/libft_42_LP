<h1> About </h1>

This is the firt main project of 42 School Common Core, `Libft`. Creating our first library in C!! Exciting, right!? Follow me and lets discover more about it!

----
<h1> First thing first: Concepts! </h1>

We must create a library in C! Okay... but what is a library? As you can imagine, its a lovely place, filled with possibilities! In our case, this place is simmilar to a repository, and the possibilities are our functions! Let's deep dive.

Whenever we code, we are writing commands to the computer and, if everything is correct, we expect a successfull output. Nevertheless, wrinting commands in C (or other language) is simply abstracting tons of minimal processes inside a computer hardware, turning on and off thousands of switches. 

Those swiches doesn't understand `while` or `if/else`, only understands zeros and ones. Thats why its binary! So, how the computer understands those complexes commands? Well, a translator is needed. And, as we know, every translator needs a sort of a dictionary. This is exactly what our library is. A dictionary!

In short, as said by [Choi and Ceballos (2020)](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs107/cs107.1206/guide/stdlib.html):

_"The term "standard library" refers to the collection of functions that are packaged with a programming language. The functionality provided can be extensive but you'll find C's standard library is quite minimal._

_It consists of dozen or so interfaces (header files) which provide facilities for reading/writing files, simple string/char handling, sort/search, generating random numbers, and primitive features for handling exceptional conditions. All of the modules are grouped into one library known as **libc**; this library is linked by default when building an executable."_
